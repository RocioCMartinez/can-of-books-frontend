## Team Agreement

### Logistical

- What hours will you be available to communicate?
ChristianRhey: class hours (9-6 PST)
Rocio: 24/7

- What platform will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?
Rocio: Slack/Remo
ChristianRhey: Slack/Remo

- How often will you take breaks?
We will break hourly for 10 mins

- What is your plan if you start to fall behind?
We will extend hours after class and we will get 3rd party help

### Cooperative

- Make a list of each person's strengths.
ChristianRhey: organizing, resourceful
Rocio: attention to detail, explaining

- How can you best utilize these strengths in the development of your application?
We will try to maintain organization  and help each other where need be.

- In what areas do you each want to develop greater strength?
ChristianRhey: Improve explaining the work (code)
Rocio: CSS for React

- Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand the code, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day development?
Move through the code step by step. Use the driver, nav roles.

### Conflict Resolution

- What will your team do if one person is pulling all the weight while the other person is not contributing?
We will discuss it, but since we are alternating the driver, nav roles periodically don’t see that happening.

- What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other member contribute?
See above.

- How will you approach each other and the challenge of building an application knowing that it is impossible for two people to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
We will seek explanations from each other, if that's not clear we will get a TAs perspective.
